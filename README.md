# CLIOS
Command line interface and what i'd like to call an operating system but i don't know what it is. it will have a custom file system, it can connect to the internet, make web and other requests, create, write, save, and load files, it has users. will it work? i have no idea. does it have a use? of course not. but it will work like an os, which is good enough for me. please report security issues if you decide to look over the code, this is my first project doing stuff with networking, so i don't know anything about security. 

## update, 8 months later

I made this before I *really* got into low-level & OSDev. I can safely say while impressive, this entire thing is almost completely useless except for being used for those who are more used to a bash terminal, i guess. it does absolutely nothing outside of acting as a psuedo-shell. but somehow, with only about a month of experince in C & Asm, i have managed to not only start work on, but continually work on my own, fully fleged [operating system](https://github.com/notsomeidiot123/kiminoOS). and holy crap is it so much more than i thought it was.

so please, to anyone who is thinking of writing an operating system, but doesnt know the work that goes into one, don't do what I did. I was a special case, and already had years of experince programming before i even *thought* about picking up C. And before this time, i tried doing it on codecademy 2 years ago and gave up because none of it made sense. 

and no, osdev is not a good way to learn. do not even consider making your own operating system until you have made several applications with C and/or Assembly. 

"Oh i've been coding in python for 3 years i'll be fin-"

lemme stop you right there. no you wont. Python is NOTHING compared to low level programming. it's essentially apples to oranges. 

if you ever want to make your own operating system, do not do what i did, but instead do this:

Learn C/C++ and Assembly. Make a game or an application IN C. do it again in assembly. Learn how memory works. 
and be sure to play the [NAND Game](https://nandgame.com). If you don't know you EAX from your SI or your RAX from you CH, learn some more.

and don't be afraid to look stuff up. there are resources out there for a reason!
